title: "This Month in Hax: September 2025"
date: 2025-10-01
---

In September, we successfully merged **44 pull requests**!

After a summer slow down, we focused on improving the new rust-written engine of
Hax (that progressively replaces the OCaml one), along with its flagship backend
(Lean), while consolidating the documentation and tutorial. We released a [new
version of hax](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1647) ðŸŽ‰

In the rust-engine, a lot of work went into the treatment of identifiers
([#1648](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1648),
[#1689](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1689),
[#1693](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1693)).

We improved the caching ([#1701](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1701),
[#1719](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1719)), and the control over
extraction [with attributes](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1685).

The Lean backend saw a lot of new features: structs, enums, basic support for
traits, support for functionalized loops. Along those, we improved the
documentation in the [tutorial](https://hax.cryspen.com/manual/lean/tutorial/) and in the
[manual](https://hax.cryspen.com/manual/lean/). The F\*-*parity* and the
official launch of the Lean backend are getting closer!

Stay tuned for more updates next month!
