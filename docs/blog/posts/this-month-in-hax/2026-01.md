In January, we successfully merged **29 pull requests**!

The Lean backend continues to get improvements, mostly thanks to [@abentkamp](https://github.com/abentkamp)! We now have more specs in the proof library (for while loops, negation and more), and improved tactics to reason with our annotations of pre/post-conditions ([\#1888](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/pull/1888)). Some naming fixes, and improvements of the handling of associated types make us closer to reaching parity with the F* backend!

The other significant improvements are on the core models side. Thanks to some new models, the F* proof library is now entirely extracted from Rust core models. The Rust primitives models will remain hand-written in each backend, but they have been designed to be as small as possible, and are intended to be modelled in a very backend-specific way. The lean library is now also partly extracted from core models! Some modules are excluded for now as they rely on Rust features that we don't support in the Lean backend for now. We will prioritize these missing features in the next few months to extend the Lean library using extraction from core models.
