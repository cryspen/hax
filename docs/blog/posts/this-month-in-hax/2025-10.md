In October, we successfully merged **15 pull requests**!

The Rust engine and Lean backend gained a monadic phase that wraps pure values and binds computations through `pure` and `lift` insertions, ensuring that the Lean backend faithfully uses the Lean `Result` monad.
A rejection phase was added to enforce Lean's do-notation DSL, preventing interleaving of expressions and statements and providing clearer diagnostics.  
We also introduced a `FunctionsToConstants` resugaring: Lean can now extract values from Rust `const`s using helper functions, guaranteeing panic-free constant evaluation.  
Struct updates are now supported via base-expression syntax, and we refactored the printer traits to return static document builders, improve span handling, and simplify lifetimes.

The F\* proof libraries now include a better `VecDeque` model and several fixes; loops without mutation are now accepted.
The Lean backend also gained improved error messages and a refactored proof library.  

Stay tuned for more updates next month!
