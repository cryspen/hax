# rust-core-models

A model of Rust's `core` and `alloc` libraries, packaged as:

1. **Rust crates** (`core-models`, `alloc`, `rust_primitives`, `std`,
   `rand_core`) that mirror the `core::*` and `alloc::*` items downstream
   verified-Rust code uses.
2. A **Lean library** (`CoreModels`) extracted from those crates by
   [Aeneas](https://github.com/AeneasVerif/aeneas), suitable for
   downstream Aeneas-extracted Lean projects to depend on as a drop-in
   `core` model.
3. An **F\* library** extracted from the same crates by
   [hax](https://github.com/cryspen/hax) into
   [`../proof-libs/fstar/core`](../proof-libs/fstar/core), where the
   generated files sit alongside hand-written F\* models.
4. A **test suite** (`tests/`) split into two surfaces:
   - `tests/client_test/` — a regression "client" crate that exercises
     items from `core::*` / `std::*` end-to-end. Its only assertion is
     that the Aeneas extraction of the crate elaborates against our
     `CoreModels` shims; it does not check behavioural agreement.
   - `tests/rust_lean_equiv_test/` — a **rust↔lean equivalence**
     framework. Each test pins one concrete behavioural observation
     (e.g. `Some(7u8).is_some() == true`), checked once on the Rust
     side via `cargo test` and once on the Lean side via a `#guard`
     against the Aeneas extraction. Divergence between Rust std and
     our model surfaces here.

## Why this exists

Verified-Rust pipelines need a model of `core` and `alloc` to elaborate
against. Writing that model in Rust (rather than directly in each
verification tool's logic) has three advantages:

- **Easy to extend**: adding a new `core::*` item is just a Rust source
  edit, no proof-assistant boilerplate.
- **Cross-testable against the real Rust core library**: the model is
  ordinary Rust, so we can compile and run it side-by-side with `std`
  and check behavioral agreement.
- **Shareable across verification tools**: a single Rust model feeds
  multiple downstream backends — currently hax-F\* and hax-Lean — instead
  of each tool maintaining its own shadow `core`.

CI verifies that the *committed* extracted Lean files under
`../proof-libs/lean/CoreModels/{Core,Alloc}/` match what a fresh extraction
produces against the pinned toolchain. That means a downstream Lean consumer can
just `lake update` this repo without installing the Rust toolchain.

## What a proof trusts

A downstream proof about hax-translated Rust rests on three things, none of
which is checked by the proof assistant itself:

1. **The Rust model** (`core-models/`, `alloc/`) — that it says what real
   `core`/`alloc` say.
2. **The hand-written backend models** — `../proof-libs/lean/CoreModels/`'s
   `RustPrimitives/Funs.lean`, `Funs{Prologue,Epilogue}.lean` and
   `TypesPrologue.lean`, plus the hand-written `.fst`/`.fsti` in
   `../proof-libs/fstar/core` (see `FSTAR_HANDWRITTEN` in the `Makefile`).
   These have no Rust counterpart; everything routed through
   `rust_primitives::*` gets its *real* meaning here.
3. **The translation** — that charon/aeneas (Lean) and hax (F\*) turn the Rust
   model into the backend definitions faithfully.

The two test surfaces cover these differently, and neither covers all three:

- **Property tests** (`#[cfg(test)] proptest!` in the model crates) compare the
  Rust model against real `std`. They exercise (1) only. For any item whose Rust
  body just calls `std` — every `rust_primitives::arithmetic` op, for instance —
  the comparison is a tautology and proves nothing.
- **Equivalence tests** (`tests/rust_lean_equiv_test/`) pin one observation and
  check it twice: once by running Rust, once by `#guard` against the extraction.
  Those cross the arrow, so they are the only check that reaches (2) and (3).

So (2) and (3) are covered *exclusively* by the equivalence tests, and only at
the inputs those tests name. `core/num_exhaustive.rs` exists for that reason: it
sweeps the `u8`/`i8` domain against references built from operations that do not
route through `rust_primitives`, which is what makes the comparison meaningful
on the Lean side.

Two further gaps worth knowing about:

- **`#[hax_lib::requires]` reaches F\* only.** Charon does not see it, so the
  Lean definition is total where the contract is not. Where that would make Lean
  disagree with a panicking Rust operation, the Lean primitive must fail
  explicitly instead (as `abs` and `rem_euclid` do).
- **`#[hax_lib::opaque]` reaches hax only.** Aeneas extracts the body regardless,
  so an `opaque` item whose Rust body is a placeholder becomes a *wrong* Lean
  definition. Such items must be `--exclude`d or `--opaque`d for charon in the
  `Makefile`; prefer `#[cfg_attr(hax_backend_fstar, hax_lib::opaque)]` when the
  body is a faithful model and only F\* needs it dropped.

## Coverage

Two different questions, two different tools.

### How much of `core` do we model?

[`COVERAGE.md`](COVERAGE.md) reports, per top-level module, how much of the
real `core` / `alloc` public API the model crates provide. It is generated by
[`tools/core-coverage`](tools/core-coverage/) (comparing rustdoc JSON of the
real std crates against the model crates). Run `make coverage` to regenerate it
(it also runs as part of the default `make` target). The numbers are an
approximate, periodically-refreshed snapshot — not a CI-enforced invariant,
because the model's rustdoc (via `hax-lib` proc macros) isn't bit-reproducible
across machines.

### How much of the model do our tests run?

`make test-coverage` runs the Rust test suite under `cargo llvm-cov` and prints
the model lines nobody exercises. This one *is* a CI-enforced invariant, and the
bar is **100%** on lines, functions and regions — so there is no threshold to
tune and no baseline file to keep in sync. `make test-coverage-check` is the gate
CI runs on every PR.

An item that cannot be exercised by a test — a `panic!()`-bodied layout
intrinsic, say — is excluded at the item:

```rust
// no observable behaviour to test: hax drops the body, layout is not modelled
#[cfg_attr(coverage_nightly, coverage(off))]
pub fn size_of<T>() -> usize {
```

which requires `#![cfg_attr(coverage_nightly, feature(coverage_attribute))]` in
that crate's `lib.rs`. `cfg(coverage_nightly)` is set only by `cargo llvm-cov`,
so ordinary builds and the extraction pipelines never see either. Reach for the
exclusion last: a model that cannot be tested cannot be checked against real
Rust.

Note that `#[hax_lib::opaque]` is *not* such a marker — it only means "do not
extract this body", and most opaque items have real, testable bodies.

Coverage says a line ran, never that a test checked its result. `make mutants`
answers the second question by mutating the model and expecting the suite to
notice; it runs nightly (`core_models_mutants.yml`) rather than per-PR, because a
sweep is ~45 minutes per cfg. It is blind to macro-generated code —
cargo-mutants cannot see `fn`s inside a `macro_rules!` body, which is most of
`num/`.

Three things about reading its output:

- **Both cfgs are needed.** A model variant gated on `cfg(hax_backend_fstar)` is
  not built by the default sweep, so its mutants never compile and every one of
  them looks like a survivor — 62 of `alloc`'s 79 at one point. `make
  mutants-genuine` intersects the two sweeps; only a mutant that survived in a
  cfg that builds it counts.
- **`--test-workspace` is on** (in the `mutants` target) because a model's
  mutants are usually killed by *another* crate's tests. With cargo-mutants'
  default of own-package tests only, 43 of `rust_primitives`' mutants survived
  spuriously.
- **A survivor can be seed-dependent.** If only some proptest inputs kill a
  mutant, it flips between runs. The fix is to make the rare case certain rather
  than to suppress it — see `test_eq_reflexive` (comparing a value with itself,
  because two independent draws almost never produce an equal `Err` pair). This
  is why the nightly gate reports rather than blocks.

Silence a genuinely unkillable mutant with `#[cfg_attr(test, mutants::skip)]` on
the function, or — where that function's other mutants are worth keeping — with
a per-mutant regex in `.cargo/mutants.toml`.

Both extracted libraries live outside this crate and are committed:
`../proof-libs/lean/` (`lakefile.toml`, `lean-toolchain`, and the
`CoreModels/` tree of hand-written + extracted files) and
`../proof-libs/fstar/core/`. The extraction pipelines below write into them.

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- `cargo hax` on `PATH` (`./setup.sh` at the root of this repository installs
  it). Override with `make HAX=/path/to/cargo-hax`. Both pipelines go through
  it; `cargo hax into lean` downloads the `charon` and `aeneas` versions hax
  pins (`cargo hax tools show`), so neither has to be on `PATH`.
- For the Lean pipeline: [`elan`](https://github.com/leanprover/elan).

### Targets

```sh
make lean           # extract Rust → Lean, patch, build the Aeneas library
make fstar          # extract Rust → F*, copy into ../proof-libs/fstar/core
make tests          # full test suite (both client_test/ and rust_lean_equiv_test/)

make test-coverage       # what model code the test suite misses
make test-coverage-check # the CI gate: 100% or fail
make mutants             # mutation testing (slow; needs a clean tree)

make clean          # remove all generated Lean + F* + LLBC, keep hand-written
```

`make lean` and `make fstar` are independent pipelines over the same Rust
sources — neither is a prerequisite of the other. 
`make lean` is idempotent: re-running without source changes is a no-op
modulo Lake's incremental build.

The F\* pipeline covers all five crates; the Lean one covers only
`core-models` and `alloc`. To extract a single crate, use the per-crate
targets (`make fstar-core-models`, `fstar-std`, `fstar-alloc`,
`fstar-rand-core`).

To run just one test surface in isolation:

```sh
make -C tests/client_test            # smoke-test extraction
make -C tests/rust_lean_equiv_test   # rust↔lean equivalence
make -C tests/rust_lean_equiv_test check-skipped   # skipped tests still fail?
```

## Testing

### Two test surfaces

**`tests/client_test/`** is a "what a downstream user touches" probe.
Its `src/lib.rs` calls a representative slice of `core::*` / `std::*`
items; the test passes iff Aeneas can extract the resulting LLBC and
the result elaborates against our `CoreModels` shims. Failures here
mean *the extraction pipeline is broken* for some surface — they say
nothing about whether Rust and Lean agree behaviourally.

**`tests/rust_lean_equiv_test/`** is the **rust↔lean equivalence
framework**. Each test pins one concrete observation and checks it
twice:

- **Rust side** — `cargo test` runs every `#[rust_lean_test] pub fn
  test_xxx() -> bool { ... }`, generated by the
  `rust_lean_test_macro` crate, and asserts the body returns `true`.
- **Lean side** — `gen_lean_tests.py` scans `source/src/**/*.rs` for
  the same attribute, finds each function's Aeneas-emitted name in
  `Funs.lean`, and emits one
  `#guard <fully-qualified-name> == .ok true` into
  `lean/RustLeanTests/LeanTests.lean`. Lake fails the build for any
  guard whose Aeneas-evaluated body is not `Result.ok true`.

Both halves must pass. Together they say: "for this concrete input,
Rust std and the Lean translation of `core_models` give the same
answer." Disagreements show up as a failed `#guard` (Lean side knows
the truth) or a failed `cargo test` assertion (Rust side knows the
truth) — same code, different oracle.

### Skipping the Lean half

`#[rust_lean_test(skip_lean = "why")]` keeps the Rust half running but emits
no `#guard`. Use it when the extraction elaborates and simply disagrees — a
model bug, or a blocker in a dependency.

Skips are tracked, not forgotten: the guards go to `SkippedTests.lean`, which
nothing imports, and `make -C tests/rust_lean_equiv_test check-skipped`
elaborates that file on purpose. Every guard in it is *expected to fail*; one
that passes means the blocker is gone, so the target fails and names the test.
CI runs it, which is what stops a skip list from silently going stale.

A test whose extraction does not *elaborate* (an unknown constant, an arity
mismatch) breaks the Lean build whether or not a `#guard` refers to it, so
`skip_lean` cannot help there — comment those out, with a `TODO` naming the
blocker.

### Adding a new item to the model

When you add an item to `core-models/src/core/foo.rs` (or `alloc/src/...`):

1. **Add one property-based test** (`proptest!`) in the same file's
   `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... }` block. This is the broad
   randomized check that the model matches Rust std across the input
   domain.
2. **Add several point tests** in
   `tests/rust_lean_equiv_test/source/src/{core,alloc}/foo.rs`
   (mirroring the source file's path under `core-models/`). Each
   point test pins one concrete behaviour with a `#[rust_lean_test]`
   attribute. Cover boundaries: zero, `MIN`, `MAX`, empty, single
   element, signed/unsigned edges, the `None`/`Err` case, etc.

The point tests in (2) are what catch *extraction* bugs — the
property-based test in (1) only knows about Rust, while the
equivalence test exercises Aeneas's translation of the same item.

#### Pitfalls

- **Typed `None`**: Aeneas drops the `T` parameter of `None::<T>` in
  zero-arg functions, leaving `Option.None` polymorphic in the
  extracted Lean. Use the helpers in
  `tests/rust_lean_equiv_test/source/src/helpers.rs`
  (`none_u8`, `none_i32`, …) rather than inline `None`. Add a
  `none_<T>` if your type isn't covered.
- **Closures**: tests that rely on `|x| ...` (e.g. `map`,
  `and_then`, `unwrap_or_else`) currently extract poorly. Comment
  them out with `// TODO(closure-extraction): ...`.
- **Only `u8` is not enough**: `u8`'s model `Clone`/`PartialEq` are total
  identity functions, so a model that takes a trait dictionary and never
  applies it looks correct at that type. Where a method's behaviour depends
  on `T`'s `Clone`/`PartialEq`, reach for `helpers::Bumped` — its `clone` is
  not the identity and its `eq` panics on `u8::MAX`. That is what caught the
  dropped dictionaries in `RustPrimitives/Funs.lean`.
- **Excluded items**: things listed in `CHARON_EXCLUDES` /
  `ALLOC_CHARON_EXCLUDES` (`core::mem::swap`, `core::slice::index::*`,
  most `Vec` indexing, `BinaryHeap`, …) come from hand-written Lean
  definitions in `../proof-libs/lean/CoreModels/Core/Funs{Prologue,Epilogue}.lean`
  and `../proof-libs/lean/CoreModels/RustPrimitives/Funs.lean`. Their
  equivalence tests live in the same file as the rest of the items
  in the same module (e.g. `core::mem::swap` tests live in
  `source/src/core/mem.rs`) — flagged with a section header noting
  they exercise a manual Lean def.

## Contributing

PRs welcome. Please:
- Run `cargo fmt --all` and `make lean tests` and `make fstar` before opening a PR 
  (CI enforces all of them).
- For every new `core::*` / `alloc::*` item:
  - Add **one property-based test** in the model crate's `#[cfg(test)]`
    block (see existing `proptest!` blocks in
    `core-models/src/core/option.rs` etc. for the pattern).
  - Add **several `#[rust_lean_test]` point tests** in
    `tests/rust_lean_equiv_test/source/src/...` covering corner cases
    of the input. See the [Testing](#testing) section for the
    motivation and the pitfalls.
- If your item is excluded from extraction (added to
  `CHARON_EXCLUDES`), the equivalence tests still go in the file that
  mirrors the item's `core::*` / `alloc::*` location — flag them with
  a section header like
  `// ----- foo (manually defined in Lean, not extracted) -----` so a
  reader knows the Lean side is hitting a hand-written definition in
  `../proof-libs/lean/CoreModels/Core/FunsPrologue.lean` (or `FunsEpilogue.lean`,
  or `RustPrimitives/Funs.lean`) rather than the extraction.
