//! Shared utilities used across the equivalence-test modules.

//! ## Why `none_T()` helpers
//!
//! Aeneas's pretty printer erases the type parameter of bare `None`
//! values that aren't anchored by a call site, so the extracted Lean
//! emits a polymorphic `Option.None` whose `T` Lean cannot infer.
//! Routing through a typed helper that constructs `None` via
//! `Some(default).take()` keeps the local typed in MIR and survives
//! extraction. Use these helpers anywhere you need a typed `None` in
//! a zero-arg test.
//!
//! Add a new `none_<T>` when you exercise an `Option<T>` for which one
//! doesn't already exist.
