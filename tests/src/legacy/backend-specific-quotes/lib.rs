//! Regression test for https://github.com/cryspen/hax/issues/2026.
//!
//! The item quote macros `hax_lib::<backend>::{before,after,replace}` expand to
//! two things: an `AssociatedItem` marker attribute on the decorated item, and a
//! companion item holding the verbatim payload. The companion item is
//! `cfg`-gated on `hax_backend_<backend>`, while the marker attribute is not:
//! when extracting to some *other* backend, the marker attribute points to an
//! item that does not exist.
//!
//! The engine used to resolve every such marker eagerly and abort with
//! `Could not find item with UID ...`. Each function below must therefore be
//! extracted fine by every backend, with the verbatim payload showing up in the
//! corresponding backend only.
//!
//! The quotes are written under `cfg_attr(hax, ...)`, the form users are
//! expected to use so that `hax-lib` is not needed when compiling normally.
